# Localtest

Localtest is a CLI tool to test stuff locally. This can be from your network to IMPROVING it?! That's right. From version 1.1 onwards, you'll be able to IMPROVE your network speeds from using Localtest. Use the command ```localtest help``` to view all available commands and flags in your current version, it'll be up-to-date. Localtest was built for Hack Club's Summer of Making.

## Localtest Network

Use ```localtest network run``` to start a quick Network test. If you have time on your hands, you should do ```localtest network run -fs``` for a full scan, which will take longer, but will be more accurate!

## Localtest Hardware

Localtest Hardware (tm) is an upcoming feature for Localtest and is to tell you which games (and tools) you can smoothly run on and which you can't smoothly run. Star this project to see more of Localtest! :3
